# SpatialEconometrics.jl
This package implements some spatial models, by their maximum likelihood estimators. 

At this initial current state, we have implemented their ML estimators and, when aplicable, effects for:
1) SAR: Spatial Autorregressive Model;
2) SEM: Spatial Error Model;
3) SAC or SARAR: Spatatial lagged dependent and error model.

Questions should me directed to the e-mail:prof@alanleal-econ.com
